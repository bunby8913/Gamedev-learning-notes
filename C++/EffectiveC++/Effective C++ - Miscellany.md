# Effective C++ - Miscellany

### Pay attention to compiler warnings

- Warning helps the programmer to spots issues with the code that are not an error, but seems like it doesn't do what the client is intended to do
- Good practice to write code that are warning-free
- Warning are implementation-dependent, so not all errors can be detected by the compiler warnings

### Familiarize yourself with Boost

- High quality, open source, platform + compiler independent libraries
- The 2 advantages of boost
	- Unique close + influential relationship with the C++ standard committee
	- A testing grounding for capabilities that could be added to standard C++
	- Uses public peer review to accept include additional libraries
- Boost offers libraries in many different topics / areas
	- String + text processing, containers, function objects + higher-order programming, generic programming, TMP, math + numeric + testing framework + data structure + inter-language support + memory

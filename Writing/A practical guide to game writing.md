# A practical guide to game writing

- Help designer to craft immersive + interactive environments
- Interesting start, several emotional peaks, then a more interesting/thoughtful ending
- Game play comes first
- Writer should be involved with the design of the game
  - The best writing should be integrated with the design of the game
- Narrative shape (What to do), motivation (Why to do), pacing (When to do)
  - Emotional shift, tonal changes, several meaningful moments
- Writing is also a part of design

#### Before writing begins

- Pre-production goals
  - High level narrative summary: Elevator pitch of the game
    - The high level narrative summary should be set and never changed again
  - Major locations/levels
    - Locations will have huge impact on the narrative, design + set early
    - Places are more important than character
    - Reduce environmental work efficiency dramatically
- In-Production goals
  - A detailed story outline: Story documents
    - Scene description
    - gameplay objectives
    - Dense + detailed
  - Story presentation plan:
    - Who's telling the story?
    - How's the story being told?
    - Who's producing the story?
  - Estimated but-scene breakdown
    - Estimate the size of cut-scene, do some basic preparation on them
  - Character
    - Character needs to be designed along side
    - Limit the # of character is important
  - Sort of text database
    - Create a data (dialogue) manage system early
      - How to store them, present them, interact with them
  - Some way to import to the text data base

#### When writings begins

- Script, first draft: 
  - First draft at first production milestone
- Demand story + sign-off
  - Do not waste time on script

#### Into production

- Casting: Set casting early (won't be part of our production)
- Final script: Script should finish early, give more time to work on other part of the game
- Voice-over recording session: won't be a part of our game
